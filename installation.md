# Installation

> Please note: this Plate generator is closed source. For this reason it does not have its own NPM package. Currently the only way to import the script is the old fashioned way. See below:

## Direct Link

Include a reference to the dependencies in the header or footer of your html file, followed by referencing the Plateit Generator:

```html
<!-- dependencies -->
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/svg.js/3.2.0/svg.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/opentype.js/1.3.4/opentype.min.js"></script>

<!-- plateit generator -->
<script src="path/to/plateit-generator.min.iife.js"></script>
```

You are now ready for the [setup](setup.md).
